- The "Fix Code in GPT/Gemini/Claude" button copies the selected code from VS.NET to the GPT/Gemini/Claude prompt area and asks AI to fix it.

- The "Improve Code in GPT/Gemini/Claude" button copies the selected code from VS.NET to the GPT/Gemini/Claude prompt area and asks AI to improve it.

- The "GPT/Gemini/Claude to VS.NET" button copies the selected text from GPT/Gemini/Claude and sends it to VS.NET.

- The "Attach Current File" button will attach current code file open in VS.NET to Claude or GPT.
  Make sure to hit enter after file is added in dialog because of security constraints

- The "Complete Code" button asks GPT/Gemini/Claude to show full complete code when it is showing partial code only.

- The "New File" button will retrieve the selected code from the page and asks for filename to add a new file with code in the project.

- The "Continue Code" button will ask the GPT/Gemini/Claude to continue the code generation when code is too long for single answer.

- The "Enable Copy Code" switch, when enabled, automatically sends the code to VS.NET when the "Copy code" button in GPT/Gemini/Claude is clicked.

- The "Arrow" button opens a submenu with other code operations that GPT/Gemini/Claude can perform.

- The "Reload Chat GPT/Gemini/Claude..." submenu reloads GPT/Gemini/Claude in the internal browser.
